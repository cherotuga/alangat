The government has been unable to raise revenue.

At the moment only the people in the formal sector are actively contributing.

Health insurance only works if we can overcome adverse selection. This can be done by making it mandatory.

But our government has weak state capacity.

How can we make the self-employed contribute?

Especially when they form the majority of the working-aged population.

The means testing tools serves the purpose of identifying their income. But it doesn't ensure compliance.

There is also an incentive to cheat. We know that if you choose that you live in a mud hut your liability will be less?

How can the government incentivise good behaviour?


We can look at what KRA has done:
- requiring a KRA PIN for bank accounts, passport applications, NTSA etc.
- it is a legal requirement to file taxes
- You need to present compliance for things

This obviously increases costs eg. an application process which requires EACC, CRB, HELB etc which is onerous and costly.

It would be good to again fold these in that you can generate them all at once.

Also the requirement to file taxes for persons and companies allows the government to cross check.

The CHPs could also be required to fill in the means testing questions for those they visit.

But because CHPs don't cover everyone that won't meet all the need.

Also harmonisation. When people fill in the questionnaire for HELB, is it linked to the SHIF one?

Then SHA also hires people to look into means-testing claims. This could be triggered, for example if for example, they are claiming high expenses like cancer etc. Right now it is only for individuals to challenge what the algorithm says. But SHA should also be able to challenge what individuals say.

Also, we allow for clawing back of premiums like if you register now, we backdate claims up to the start of SHIF. But perhaps incentivise like there have been recent stories in the UK of how the government allows you to pay the years you missed out of NI to qualify for pension. So to qualify for coverage, we do it by number of years of contribution so you can buy back years and receive more coverage. The premium amount will be your current assessed premium/ what was done but the scale is the number of years.

I wonder if dependents should also include the aged like if your parents are retired, they could be added to your cover? And in that way also means testing covers that. This is a true reflection of our dependency as is.


In the UK the NI is also kinda like a tax.

Maybe SHIF and NSSF should also be like taxes so that you also need to prove compliance.

Important to remember that there are costs:
- already distrust in the population
- monitoring costs
- time costs for CHPs
- privacy concerns around linking systems
- allows for corruption in investigations

Also look up the challenges of KRA eg. in implementing TIMS
