Also ambitious: 

How are migrant workers treated:
 - legally
 - wages
 - history


How did this come about?
Both internal and external.
But mostly internal migration
Think also of rural-urban migration esp. in Africa

Also internally like the fact that Finlays is made up of Kisii

How about the stereotype that househelps and watchmen are Luhyas

Also govt policy where all police and KDF are Kales.

Starting point could be looking at the census:
 - population who grow without both parents
 - average age of farmers
 - ethnic composition (?)
 - work status

These could be series that I choose to focus on.
But only when I've finished what I said I'd do.

In SA that miners are from:
- Zimbabwe, Angola, Malawi etc.

That the history of Bantustans

That domestic workers commute a long way if live-out

For us in Kenya, slums neighbour affluent areas as a way to perhaps overcome this. But for the people living in slums, it is likely that they are migrants.
