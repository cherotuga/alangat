PPPs have been encouraged by people like the World Bank.

But they have largely failed to live up to their hype.

Ruto wants to go to China to convince them to use PPP to expand the road.

What are the touted benefits?
- Efficiency of the private sector
- Increased economic activity
- Revenue from govt.



Get where this has failed.


Look into why did the French/ AFDB pull out of funding this in the first place.

And why did Kenya move away from tolls to road taxes:
- is it fair to tax us twice?
