So I get my hair done at Kenyatta Market.

It is much nicer than other markets.

Cabro and tiles so no mud

Covered walkways

Gutters + drainage

I think that there is garbage collection but not sure

There is electricity with individual points

There isn't water in the taps but there is a tank

Generally, have to have a permit 

There is a police post

Equity bank has set up there: the private sector

It has a gate

There are floodlights

I wonder who did this: was it Kidero? Or perhaps pre-devolution?


Look for both scientific studies and newspaper reports.
