Structure of what I need to know:

1. What government has done eg:

- The immunities act for non-profits
  - Use Kenya Gazette to find who has been exempted and why
  - Has the UN helped New York or Geneva especially now that they are moving to Kenya?
- EPZ
- "Derisking" - more of the multinationals
- Liberalisation of laws
- PPPs
- Fads in the West eg. carbon credits: what projects are these? Can we see the benefits in eg. County GDP or increased forest cover from satellite images?

2. What effect has this had

- First look at what other people have done to measure this
  - Job creation
  - Economic growth
  - companies being formed
  - infrastructure development
    - also think about quality, time taken etc.
  - debt 
  - tax revenue for the government
- Think about the World Bank Doing Business Report
  - What does it measure
  - How has Kenya performed
  - Are there concrete links to things changing?
- What are the narratives around this
  - Social media sentiment
  - Newspaper reports
  - Government speeches etc.

I want to understand the institutional context before thinking of econometric approaches to this.
