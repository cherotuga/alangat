I think the government is attempting to tax wealth instead of income.
I think there is a belief that this is easier.

So I'm thinking like:
- SHA using proxy means testing
- The car tax

So, I would like to be ambitious:
- Compile taxes and identify what are wealth taxes
- Look at impact of wealth taxes

Do a larger thinking around tax eg. consumption vs income vs wealth.

Check if KRA attempts to quantify impact

Or if the finance bills are accompanied by justifications.
