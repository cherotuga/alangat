This was motivated by seeing a man/ woman at the back of a double cab pickup.

If the reservation wages are high, employers will need to provide dignity.

But some things that lower are:
- immigration  status
- the lack of other options ie. we in Kenya have farms back home


Have there been empirical investigations on reservation wages. This could be something to look into?

And how can policy increase reservation wages?
Also look into whether this seems to have worked empirically beyond theory.
So quick thoughts:
- Unemployment insurance
- Land reforms
- Family support
