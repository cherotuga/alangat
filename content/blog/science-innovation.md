After my discussion with Abel, I wonder if we have the capacity for biotech startups.

Things like vaccines, diagnostic kits etc. for livestock diseases.

I think the problem is that even if people innovate, there is no market.
And this is because we have low purchasing power.

What happened to those things made during COVID?

I will look up what Wandia Njoya said for a philosophical/sociological perspective.
But I would also like to look up the numbers etc.
Follow up on their stories.

Maybe begin with looking at the newspapers.
What was reported then try and follow up.

But also compile list of grant makers.
Who are the people who fund innovative ideas?

And look up the work of somebody like Watu Wamae.
